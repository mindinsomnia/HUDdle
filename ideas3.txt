Logic...

	server starts...

	clients connect..

	protocol handlers need to act as adapters between server logic and communicating with clients..

	So, the ProtocolHandlers need to be able to receive commands from the client, and receive events from the connections themselves.

	So it looks something like this...

	index.js is the entry point

	AppConfig.js is responsible for being an abstraction layer over server settings
	and is a singleton, importable from anywhere, and makes it easy to get/set settings,
	and automatically saves/loads settings. It has a schema it can apply to data loaded
	from config file, to ensure whatever data is loaded will conform with expected types.

	DataStorage.js can act as an abstraction layer over the data storage system for
	storing all the data the server manages. It can present models of data types with
	methods for creating/deleting/updating/fetching/searching data.

	HUDdleServer.js can act as the hub of server logic, with methods for creating/deleting
	users, adding messages, creating channels, etc. It interacts with DataStorage. It
	can provide an interface for handling events from connected clients and timers, etc.

	WebUIServer.js can be responsible for providing a web based UI for the server. This
	could be used for management/admin of the server, as well as providing a web based
	interface to the server for connecting without having a client installed.

	WSServer.js is responsible for setting up web sockets, and sending events to the
	HUDdleServer when clients do things. It's also responsible for creating WSConnection
	objects for each connecting, which are responsible for receiving client commands
	and processing them.

	The WSConnections process commands up to the point of receiving a handshake on a
	protocol selection. Once that is received, the appropriate protocol handler can be
	used from protocols/version_N/ProtocolHandlerVersionN.js.

	ProtocolHandlers are responsible for taking commands and interpretting them, then
	translating them into events that can be fired on the HUDdleServer. Events such as the
	event of a client sending a chat message. It's up to the HUDdleServer to decide how to
	process this event, and if it will process it at all. This allows for example, for a
	a protocol handler to send the appropriate events to the server for a client trying to
	use an old discontinued feature, and for the server to just ignore that, and send back
	a response like 'We don't do that any more', for the protocol handler to then reply to
	the client with an appropriate 'failure' command.

	This gives us a few utility classes like EventDispatcher which can be used in anything
	which is event based.

	And CommandProcessor which can take care of loading multiple commands from a folder
	path and processing the appropriate command depending on the json received.

	We also need to store the concept of a 'ClientSession' too, because a connection will
	need to store these, and if a client reconnects to an existing session, then we need to
	be able to reload a session too, and we need to know if a session is already in use.

	So lets say we have a running server, and a client wants to send a chat message.
	What does that look like?

	Client sends text to server, something like,
	{ cmd: "send_chat_message", id: .., rt: ..., data: { conversationId: ..., message: ... } }

	That's received by WSConnection. Which by that point would have selected a ProtocolHandler.
	The message can be sent to the protocol handler, which can then check if the text is a
	valid command, and if it is then it can process it with an appropriate command handler.
	The command handler would be something like 'send_chat_message.js', and it would need
	to have a reference to the HUDdleServer, so it could create an event. Something like..

	huddleServer.v1.sendChatMessage({fromUserId, toConversationId, message}) ?

	The huddleServer will clearly need to operate as some kind of fixed version..

	So for example if the version of the server is 3.4, and it's operating version 9 of the
	protocol. That version may have added and removed some features, as well as added
	requirements for certain functions that earlier clients didn't have...

	It will be necessary for the server to specify what versions of the protocol it
	supports, and forr that information to go to the WSConnections too.. and necessary
	for each of the supported interfaces to be available to the protocol handlers.

	Then lets say huddleServer.v1.sendChatMessage takes that data, forwards it to a general
	purpose sendChatMessage, like huddleServer.sendChatMessage, with the appropriate args,
	what then?

	Well the server will likely need to use the DataStorage to make sure the conversation
	exists, make sure the user exists, etc, do a bunch of validation. And respond with
	some kind of status on the request. That'll have to go to the huddleServer.v1.send..
	so it can send an appropriate response back to the protocolhandler. And so it can
	send a response back to the client.

	Lets say the message is added to the data storage, that means we'll need some kind of
	event for 'chat_message' which can be detected by the server. And then handle, so for
	example, will need to then check which clients are connected, and if any of them are
	logged in as users participating in that conversation, and distribute the message to
	all of them.

  But at that point the event could be coming from a protocol 9 server and need to go
  out to clients running protocol 9, 8, 7 and 6. So somehow the protocol handlers need
  to receive these events in a way that is shaped for them. Maybe it can be the responsibility
  of the huddle server event handler to check the protocol handler version and call the
  appropriate function. That way we keep the protocol handlers fairly dumb and it's the
  server which is handling the different protocol versions instead.

  Or maybe there can be some kind of adapter layer here. So the server sends a message
  to ServerToClientAdapterProtocolVersion9 (or some other better name) that is responsible
  for translating that into something the ProtocolHandler expects.
  This could then potentially be part of the ProtocolHandler itself.

  So what I'm thinking is we need a kinda.. wrapper...

  Like you make a HUDdleServer, but then if you want to give that server to a client
  connected with protocol 8, while the server is running protocol 9, you wrap
  the server in something like a Server9ForProtocol8Adapter(huddleServer).
  And that has all the methods that a protocol handler on version 8 would expect, and
  it translates them to protocol 9. Likewise for the protocol handler then,
  you'd have a Protocol8ForServer9AdapterprotocolHandler), that has all of the methods that
  a protocol 9 server would expect, but maps them to the protocol 8 handler.

  Ideally the goal here is, if we add new versions of the protocol and expand the sevrer
  with new functionality and new commands, maintaining support for old versions of the
  protocol should ideally involve minimal if any changes of code to the existing protocol
  handlers as possible.

  What's needed is probably some kind of system of layers of upgrade/downgrade.

  So like, lets say a message comes from a protocol 7 client. There could be a series of
  upgraders. Like it starts with the protocol 9 upgrader that gets the first pass to
  upgrade the message to protocol 9 level. If it passes, then the protocol 8 upgrader
  gets a chance instead. And if protocol 8 passes, then the message arrives as it was
  originally sent.

  Then lets say the message is going to a client from the server. It could start with
  a protocol 9 downgrader which gets a chance to downgrade a message to a specific
  protocol version, and format. If it passes, then the protocol 8 downgrader gets a
  chance to do so instead. Otherwise the message goes straight to the protocol 7.

  That way, all previous efforts at downgrading/upgrading protocol messages can be
  reused and new upgrade/downgrade efforts can be simply added on top of that.
